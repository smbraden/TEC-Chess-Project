Some tasks to be completed in finishing up the ChessBoard class

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------//

Implement the following rules and condition checks:


-Castling
-Pawn promotion

-En Passant (aka, "why are pawns so needy?")
En passant itself can only occur in a game when a player exercises 
his option to move his pawn two squares on its initial movement and 
that move places his pawn next to the opponent’s pawn.
When this happens, the opposing player has the option to use his pawn 
to take the moved pawn “en passant” or “in passing” as if the pawn had 
only moved one square.

-Check and checkmate (and Stalemate?)

-Three-fold repetition
This rule states that if the same position is repeated three times 
and no progress is made, you can claim a draw. 
Two positions are by definition "the same" if the same types of pieces 
occupy the same squares, the same player has the move, the remaining 
castling rights are the same and the possibility to capture 
en passant is the same. The repeated positions need not occur in succession. 

DONE:

-Pawn capture via diagonals and prohibit false Pawn "captures" via row moves
implement via ChessBoard; need board information









//--------------------------------------------------------------------------//

Derive a Grandmaster board class?

- 50 move rule
The rule states that you can claim a draw if there has been no capture 
and if no pawn has been moved in the previous 50 moves.
