Some tasks to be completed in finishing up the ChessBoard class

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------//

Implement the following rules and condition checks:

-Pawn capture via diagonals (challenging)
-Check and checkmate
-Castling
-Pawn promotion
-Stalemate?

Obscure rules:

-Three-fold repetition
This rule states that if the same position is repeated three times 
and no progress is made, you can claim a draw. 

-En Passant
En passant itself can only occur in a game when a player exercises 
his option to move his pawn two squares on its initial movement and 
that move places his pawn next to the opponent’s pawn.

When this happens, the opposing player has the option to use his pawn 
to take the moved pawn “en passant” or “in passing” as if the pawn had 
only moved one square.

Derive a Grandmaster board class?

- 50 move rule
The rule states that you can claim a draw if there has been no capture 
and if no pawn has been moved in the previous 50 moves.
