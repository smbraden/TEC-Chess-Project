# TEC-Chess-Project
 
This repo is for The Engineering Club's chess game application.

The the VS project folder appended with "Console" is for working on the backend classes. The prject folder appened with "Desktop" is a VS auto-generated "Desktop Application." Integration for desktop functionality is a future goal.
